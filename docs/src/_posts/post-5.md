# Thoughts and Improvement

- Jakob: adjust size after number of persons. Strawberries also in the vanila cream's layer.(current: first layer with jam+cream, second layer with vanila cream)
- Hyunjin: more layers for strawberry decorations. Would be nice to put smaller strawberry pieces into the cake and use only big parts.

# Recipes

### Vanilla cream

1. Crack the egg and separate the yolk from the white. Stir together egg yolks, powdered sugar and cornstarch in a bowl.
2. Pour the milk into a thick-bottomed saucepan. Divide the vanilla bean lengthwise. Scrape out the seeds and place them and the rod in the saucepan.
3. Bring to the boil while stirring. Then whisk the warm milk into the bowl and mix well.
4. Pour everything back into the saucepan.
5. Boil the mixture until it has thickened into a cream. Stir constantly. Lower the heat and cook for another 2 minutes. Pour the vanilla cream into a bowl, add the butter and stir until the butter has melted. Pick up the vanilla bean. Cover the cream with plastic wrap so that the foil rests against the surface of the cream. Allow to cool completely in the refrigerator.

### Bottoms

1. Preheat the oven to 200 degrees, hot air function. Place parchment paper in the bottom of a round form with a removable edge, 22-24 cm in diameter. (Do not grease and break the edge, because in this way the cake "sticks" to the edges and becomes high and fine.)
2. Put wheat flour, potato flour and baking powder in a strainer and sift the mixture into a bowl. Mix eggs and powdered sugar in a saucepan over medium heat and heat to finger warm while stirring. Pour the mixture into a bowl and whisk it white and fluffy with an electric whisk, for at least 10 minutes.
3. Mix a little at a time of the flour mixture and stir gently with a spatula to a smooth batter. Pour the batter into the mold, smooth to the surface and bake in the middle of the oven for about 20 minutes. Test with a stick that the cake is baked through.
4. Take the mold out of the oven and turn it directly upside down on a baking sheet. Let stand until the cake has cooled completely.
5. Carefully cut along the sides to release the cake from the mold. Divide it into three even bottoms when it's time to assemble. Tip: Leave the cake in the freezer for 1 hour before, so it will be easier to cut.

### Mounting

1. Place the bottom of a cake pan. Spread a thin layer of strawberry jam on top. Then spread a thin layer of whipped cream on top of the jam.
2. Lay the top base upside down so that the baked surface is against the cream. Spread a thin layer of vanilla cream on top and then sprinkle with divided strawberries.
3. Place a solid layer of whipped cream on top. Shape the cream flat.
4. Put on the last base and cover the whole cake with cream

Garnish: Sprinkle a pattern along the edge of the cake and decorate in the middle with strawberries.
