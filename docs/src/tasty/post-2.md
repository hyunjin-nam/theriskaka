# Three best ice-cream places in Stockholm üç¶

## 1. SN√ñ

My favourite ice-cream place in Stockholm. There is a great selection of flavours with unique combinations such as the combination of vanilla, banana, and cola. Usually, there is a long queue to buy this ice cream. I think the best part of this place is their waffle coneüëå Very much soft and sweet that will refresh your mouth even after finishing your ice-cream. I would like to recommend you to try this place with waffle cone and walk around the park that is right in front of this store üôÜüèª‚Äç!

## 2. Fj√§llgatans Kaffestuga


This is the best ice-cream place if you are looking for a fine ice-cream with a wide view of Stockholm! This is located right next to the S√∂dermalm's cliff where you can look around the city from the top of the hill! You can find Gamlastan, Gr√∂nalund, a lot of cruises that come all around the world ‚õ¥! Ofc, ice-cream taste so good! I would recommend an Apelsin Choklad and Cheese Cake flavours with v√•fflor! They will put little red jelly on the top of the ice-cream which will make you takes some photos for your Instagram!

## 3. Edsvikens Piazza & Gelateria Norr M√§larstrand



Sometimes you might feel Stockholm is literally an island, where you can feel bit isolated or lonely for somehow. During this Summer, right after I had finished with my Master's thesis, I felt a bit bored of doing nothing and lost like as a person who has nowhere to go. One Summer day, I met my previous colleague at this ice-cream store and had a talk about random topics‚òÄÔ∏è And I felt very much revived after having ice-cream with her at this place. Taste of the ice-cream is a bit light in a very good way, not too sugary, but lagom sweetness which can refresh you from warm and boring Summer. This place is not so much far away from Stockholm city hall so that you can pass by beautiful architecture on the way as well üö∂‚Äç
